# Adaboosting
1.  Implement the AdaBoost algorithm in R. The algorithm requires two auxiliary functions, to train and evaluate the weak learner.  I also need a third function which implements the resulting boosting classifier. In this project, I use decision stumps as weak learners.
2.  Implement the functions train and classify for decision stumps.
3.  Run  my  algorithm on the USPS  data and evaluate your results using cross validation.
4.  Plot the training error and the test error.
